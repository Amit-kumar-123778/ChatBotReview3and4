This project implements a simple AI-driven chatbot that can engage in natural language conversations. The bot is designed to assist users with common queries, provide recommendations, or handle basic tasks depending on the specific use case. It uses machine learning models, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and conversational AI techniques to understand and generate human-like responses.
